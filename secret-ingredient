Social-Capital: understanding others specifically those you work with,
in a greater way that makes everyone work more efficient.
Trust and empathy are extremely important to me. It really makes sense that
trust and empathy will help you in the work environment and with your
co-workers. Empathy can help you get to know someone and trust can help you
work together better.
