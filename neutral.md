1. Gender-Neutral Languages: I do believe there should be more gender-neutral
language. People, including me, use language that is not neutral without
thinking about it. If I hear people say "you guys" even though there are girls
in the room, I don't really mind it because I too say it when I am addressing
people informally. I think it might be part of our culture in New England because
almost everyone says it without thinking. It is a good idea for websites because
it creates biases, especially with jobs. I also I agree with using it
while addressing the group and in the workplace.
