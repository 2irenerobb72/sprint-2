I did pair programming with Aaron, we did Javascript. I was the Driver
so I had control of the keyboard, Aaron was the navigator. It was successful,
I had a little trouble at the beginning and with number 3. Aaron helped me
with solve the problem by myself by asking questions that I had to answer.
I found it very useful.
