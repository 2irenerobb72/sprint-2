        <p>The HTML Article Element(&gt;article&gt;) represents a self-contained
        composition in a document, page, application, or site, which is
        intended to be independently distributable or reusable (e.g.,
        in syndication). This could be a forum post, a magazine or newspaper
        article, a blog entry, an object, or any other independent item
        of contentt. Each &gt;article&gt; should be indentified, typically
        by including a heading(h1-h6 element) as a child of the  article
        element.</p>

        <p>The HTML &gt;aside&gt; element represents a section of the page with
        content connected tangentially to the rest, which could be
        considered separate from that content. These sections are often
        represented as sidebars or inserts. They often contain the
        definitions on the sidebars, such as definitions from the glossary;
        there may also be other types of information, such as related
        advertisements; the biography of the author; web applications;
        profile information or related links on the blog.</p>

          <p>The HTML Navigation Element (&gt;nav&gt;) represents a section of a page

        <p>The HTML Section Element (&gt;section&gt;) represents a generic section of
        a document, i.e., a thematic grouping of content, typically with a
        heading. Each &gt;section&gt; should be identified, typically by
        including a heading (&gt;h1&gt;-&gt;h6&gt; element) as a child of the
        &gt;section&gt; element.</p>
