I'm constantly showing empathy and sympathy to people around me and people
I don't know. I grew up that way, I think, because of my mom she is always
saying "put yourself in their shoes and see how you feel". I frequently
feel empathy for my mom and the amount of work she has to do and I help
her out because of it. I think it's totally worth it to have empathy for
people and it's not difficult at all. Because I love to help people and
be selfless.
